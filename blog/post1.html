    <h1>Grading Conflict in Rock Climbing</h1>
    <p><em>July 30, 2025</em></p>

    <p>In rock climbing, grades (the difficulty of a climb) are a big part of the status of a climber. The way climbing grades were determined until now was by consensus. The first person to climb a route or boulder problem would propose a grade, and those who came next could accept it or suggest an upgrade or downgrade.</p>

    <p>This system works well at a local level. Those who climbed in the same area developed a sense of the difficulty associated with a grade and proposed grades for new climbs based on that.</p>

    <p>At a global level, however, it causes constant tension. Even though climbing grades are supposed to be universal (some countries use different scales, but there are conversion tables), we all know they are not. American climbers say Spanish grades are soft, New River Gorge climbers think Red River Gorge grades are stiff, and so on.</p>

    <p>For amateurs, this tension mostly transpires in the form of jokes, complaining, and frustration for some, but most people come to accept grades as a locally agreed-upon system of knowledge that can be learned with some local experience. You get your ass kicked once or twice on a climb that, on paper, should have been your warm-up, and then you learn to interpret grades locally.</p>

    <p>At the elite level, however, the stakes are higher. Athletes compete for recognition and sponsors. Climbing is a sport where multiple logics of success co-exist. For instance, Alex Honnold, probably the most well-known climber, does not climb much harder routes than some of the local climbers back in my hometown. But none of them are even close to being professional climbers. Alex Honnold made his fame through the recognition of his boldness. But climbing hard grades is still the dominant logic of success, and the one most aspiring professional climbers go after.</p>

    <p>So the system is rife for conflict. A difficulty grading scale that is only coherent at a local level but that determines rewards for a global elite of climbers.</p>

    <p>The most common solution for this has been to trust climbers based on their record. For instance, if you want to propose a new V17 boulder problem (the hardest grade that currently exists), you'd better have climbed other V17 problems proposed by other climbers before. Otherwise, our trust in you to understand the difficulty of the grade is weak.</p>

    <p>This system is distasteful. It requires that climbers call each other out when they think that a grade they proposed is inflated. And the elite climbing community is small, and nobody wants to call out their friend for proposing a grade too hard when they know that might hurt their career.</p>

    <p>But what alternative is there? Behold quantification. The latest trend in climbing is now to use apps with algorithmic rules that determine the difficulty of a climb. They usually work by splitting the climb into sections, assigning a grade to each one, and then applying the algorithm to determine the global grade of the climb. This still requires a subjective evaluation from the climber to evaluate each section, but now the subjectivity of the final grade is hidden behind the veil of the algorithm. Everyone agrees that this is kind of silly, but it is still catching on. It gives grades an air of objectivity, which is particularly useful for those trying to make their way into professional climbing and who do not yet have the status necessary to be trusted as an authority in the field.</p>

    <p>It will be interesting to see if, as in other fields like university rankings, alternative algorithms are proposed and whether the field will converge into a single one or sustain a multitude of them.</p>
