    <h1>The Structure of Academic Hierarchies</h1>
    <p><em>August 10, 2025</em></p>
	
	
<p>Status creeps into many aspects of academic life. Conferences are a great  place to observe its effects. Like how we use institutional affiliations in presentations and name tags. Not that they are necessary, most times you can approximate the status of the institution a professor belongs to by simply observing how often they get approached and the deference with which they are treated by students. Status hierarchies are *structuring structures* (the **structured structures** part we can skip it). The effects of their architecture affects the field (Accominoti Lynn and Sauder have written about this at length <a href="https://www.rsfjournal.org/content/rsfjss/8/6/87.full.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>  
	
<p>But here I want to talk about my  preferred way to think about status hierarchies, as well as present an example from a current project on the effects of rankings on academic philosophy. The way I like to think about status hierarchies is as having 4 dimensions. The first 3 denote its shape: height, width, and depth. The fourth one is sharpness.</p>

<p>Width is a measure of how many elements in the hierarchy can hold approximately the same status. Thinking in ideal typical terms, the ivy league hierarchy is a wide one. There are Ivys and non-Ivys, but neither is an exclusive category. University rankings, on the other hand, are narrow, because they force status separation between universities (except when more than one end up sharing the same rank).</p>

<p>Height is a measure of the separation between the rungs of the hierarchy. University rankings is a tall hierarchy because the status difference between the first and last element is quite pronounced. The Ivy league classification on the other hand is a short one. MIT or Stanford are not Ivys, just like my alma mater, the university of Salamanca, which means that to the eyes of this classification system (again, in an ideal typical sense), they have the same status. Width and heigh might be empirically correlated but it is not a necessary relationship, one can think of inconsequential rankings which are narrow and short (do not signal much status difference).</p>

<p>Depth is to me the most interesting dimensions to me. It is a temporal dimensions, that is, how far back into the past or future does this status hierarchy extend? Or in terms of careers within a field, how structured or predictable does it make them? In academia, the tenure track system has a significant depth to it. Moves are highly restricted (you can only go up or out, and one rung at a time) and it defines spans 20 years or so of one's career. In terms of depth, the tenure track system is somewhere in between a caste system (where your class of birth defines you for the rest of your life) and a sport's ranking (where performance has to be proven on a regular basis to sustain one's ranking).</p>

<p>The fourth dimension is sharpness. This is a measure of salience or consensus. The tenure track system is very sharp, because everyone agrees that professors are higher status than assistant professors. The ranking of academic institutions is sharp at the head and more blurry in the middle and bottom (as this blog post shows).</p>

<p>Back in the real world, the status hierarchy of an academic field is always a mixture of classifications.</p>

<p>Here is an example of an academic status hierarchy. The figure shows the hiring flows between the top X philosophy departments in the United States according to the <a href="https://philosophicalgourmet.com/overall-rankings/" target="_blank"> PGR</a>. Te data includes all current faculty. Each line is a link between the institution where they obtained their PhD and their current employer. The orange lines are upward moves (current department is higher ranked than PhD department) and the blue lines are downward moves. I rank departments using <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aar8260" target="_blank"> Spring Rank</a>, which minimizes downward moves. Note that this ranking looks very different from the PGR.</p>

<p>Downward moves are the norm. This is in part because some of the top departments produce more students, but it does not explain all of the pattern. A null model assuming similar rates of PhD production is plotted on the right. On average, PhDs moving within these departments go down 2.1 ranks. I ran one thousand realizations of the null model and the closest it got was 1.2 ranks down. Notwithstanding the main pattern of downward mobility, among this group of elite departments, there are significant number of upward moves (61 of these philosophers went ip the ranks, out of the 201 faculty members in these departments). The longest upward move in my data is ZoÃ« A. Johnson King who go er PhD in Michigan and is not at Harvard. Longer moves exist, like Samantha Matherne who went from UC Riverside also to Harvard, but I am collecting data department by department, moving from the top down so it will take a bit longer until this moves appear in my data. Again, only looking at the peak of this status hierarchy, this seems a relatively wide one. All departments hire from lower ranker ones, which at the peak is necessary given the unwritten norm that departments should not hire their own PhDs (although nowadays it has become more common and in departments like Princeton a 20% of faculty are homegrown).</p>

<p>At the bottom of this list we can start to see signs of the height of this hierarchy. USC has only two of their PhDs placed in top 10 departments (both of them at Michigan) and UT Austin has 1 (also at Michigan), even though these departments are highly regarded according to the PGR survey. Even among these few departments we can see it is a long way to the top. As for the width of the hierarchy, one could look at how sticky the status of one's PhD institution is by studying mid-career moves. In a deep hierarchy, these would be extremely infrequent (even conditional on how unlikely upward moves in general already seem to be).</p>

<p>As to the sharpness of the hierarchy of philosophy departments, one can peek at that by looking at the variance in the votes of the PGR, as <a href="https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2014/12/08/visualizing-philosophy-rankings/" target = "_blank">Kieran did</a>. Looks like, about 10 years ago, consensus was high on NYU being the best department, with the variance increasing as you go down the ranks.</p>
